## Welcome to TechLearn
I created this repository to track things that I have learnt over a period of time. It helps me to stay in touch with them and refer them as and when needed.

This repository is not very exhaustive on each topic. It is also a work in progress.

## References
It is only fair to give due credit to the original content. This repository is created by reading content from various sources.
Wherever possible, an attempt has been made to add a reference to the actual work. However, some of the web content is saved as
.pdf file here to avoid an unpleasant situation if the article no longer exists. It also allows to have all relevant reading 
material at one place. I would like to thank the contributors on following websites (definitely not an exhaustive list) as I referred to their articles and examples:

 * [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
 * [Medium](https://medium.com/)
 * [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
 * [dZone](https://dzone.com/)
 * [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm)
 * [Java Revisited](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/)
 * [Geek Narrator](https://geeknarrator.com/about/)

## Collaboration
It will be great if this repository can help you in any possible way. Please feel free to fork. I am also looking forward to know more about different technologies, languages and concepts. Your pull request will always be welcome.

Happy learning!
